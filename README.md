This repository hosts the code to the `lucid-from-html` tool, derived from [@jaspervdj](https://github.com/jaspervdj).
It is quite rough, and doubtless many examples do not work.
The test suite is in progress.

Please report any issues (including examples of html files that don’t parse correctly) at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dbaynard/lucid-from-html/issues).
